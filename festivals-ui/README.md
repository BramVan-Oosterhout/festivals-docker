fesyivals-ui implements a user interface to the FestivalsApp backend using the open source Enterprise wiki (Foswiki)[https://foswiki.org]. This interdace was build as an experiment in using the FestivalsApp and is not mant to be a front end. 

The current implementation is far from optimal. On the positve side, the implementation does illustrate the capabilities of the FestivalsApp. Four views have been implemented, represented by their web page name_

| View | Purpose |
| === | === |
| FestivalsApp | A list of festivals available for perusal with the date(s) they are held and the number of events and performances aon offer. |
| FestivalsEventsByDAy | A list if events for the selected festival, sorted by date and time |
| FestivalsArtistsAtoZ | A list of the artists performing at the festival, sorted by name. |
| FestivalsArtist | The information avalable for an artist and the date(s) they are performing. |
