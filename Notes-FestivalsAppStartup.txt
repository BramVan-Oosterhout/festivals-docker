Notes on Festivals-App

the servers on festivals app start and LISTEN on bindhost and port

At startup the heartbeat notifies the festivals-gateway that the server is  up and listening at bindhost:port
   - bindhost takes the form of festivals-<server>

From there all communication could in principle go via festivals-gateway/request and be routed appropriately.
But the server can also be addressed directly through festivals-<server>:port/request
 - if the correct certificates are presented.
